-----------------------------------

1.	Once you’ve extracted the contents of the .zip file, open the “html” folder and double-click on the “cs325.html” file in order for it to open in your default browser.
2.	You’re all set! As long as you left all the folders in the same root folder, then cs325.html should work just fine and you should be able to test out our project.
